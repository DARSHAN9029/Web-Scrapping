# Web-Scrapping
Web scrapping using Selenium and BeautifulSoup

1. bb_scarp.py – Uses Selenium to fetch the HTML content of a webpage based on a user-provided query (e.g., product name) and URL.

2. data_collect.py – Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the retrieved HTML and save the extracted data into CSV, Excel, or JSON format, as per user requirements.
